				<h3>WORK IN THE FIELD BEFORE GRADUATION</h3>
				<blockquote>
					Champlain College Saint-Lambert offers its students the additional advantage of experience in the field during the sixth semester, placing each student with a company for a 12-week work-study assignment. The company engages the student for work onsite in areas such as programming, client support, system development, network and database support, e-Commerce, gaming, multimedia, etc. This experience has proved invaluable to our graduates: they can provide a potential employer with a reference in the field, and many of our students have been offered jobs upon graduation by the employers with whom they were placed.
				</blockquote>

				<h3>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
				<blockquote>
					Prospects for both employment and advancement in the Information Technology industry are excellent. Over the past three years, the demand for IT professionals in Canada has doubled as baby boomers opt for retirement. The typical starting salary upon graduation is $45,000.
				</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>
					A career as a Computer Programmer Analyst can provide you with exciting and rewarding work in areas such as: computer programming, web development, systems development, data modeling, and database administration.
