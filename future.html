The company engages the student for work onsite in areas such as programming, client support, system development, network and database support, e-Commerce, gaming, multimedia, etc. This experience has proved invaluable to our graduates: they can provide a potential employer with a reference in the field, and many of our students have been offered jobs upon graduation by the employers with whom they were placed.
