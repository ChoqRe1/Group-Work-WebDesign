            <h3>COMPUTER SCIENCE - LEGACY TO MOBILE COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM (420.A0)</h3>
            <p>The Legacy to Mobile (L2M) program provides a unique experience in developing and supporting computer systems to satisfy business requirements. Graduates are well trained for a career as a programmer analyst or as technical support. Students
                will also benefit from excellent on-site training at companies, which may lead to full-time jobs.</p>
            <p>Our courses are constantly evolving to meet the needs of employers. Learning takes place in both the classrooms and computer labs. Our teachers bring sound knowledge and experience to the classroom. This three-year program is well-suited for
                students who are interested in computer programming. Champlain has become one of the few c√©geps in Quebec to offer mainframe programming and, through our partnership with the well established Fresche Legacy, students will have access to
                mainframe resources. In addition, students will focus on IT modernization solutions, which include programming for mobile platforms such as tablets and phones.</p>
