	<h2>COMPUTER SCIENCE - LEGACY TO MOBILE COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM (420.A0)</h2>
	<p>The Legacy to Mobile (L2M) program provides a unique experience in developing and supporting computer systems to satisfy business requirements. Graduates are well trained for a career as a programmer analyst or as technical support. Students will also benefit from excellent on-site training at companies, which may lead to full-time jobs.</p>
	
	<p>Our courses are constantly evolving to meet the needs of employers. 	Learning takes place in both the classrooms and computer labs. Our teachers bring sound knowledge and experience to the classroom. This three-year program is well-suited for students who are interested in computer programming. Champlain has become one of the few c√©geps in Quebec to offer mainframe programming and, through our partnership with the well established Fresche Legacy, students will have access to mainframe resources. In addition, students will focus on IT modernization solutions, which include programming for mobile platforms such as tablets and phones.</p>

	<h2>WORK IN THE FIELD BEFORE GRADUATION</h2>
	<p>Champlain College Saint-Lambert offers its students the additional advantage of experience in the field during the sixth semester, placing each student with a company for a 12-week work-study assignment. The company engages the student for work onsite in areas such as programming, client support, system development, network and database support, e-Commerce, gaming, multimedia, etc. This experience has proved invaluable to our graduates: they can provide a potential employer with a reference in the field, and many of our students have been offered jobs upon graduation by the employers with whom they were placed.</p>

	<h2>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
	<p>Prospects for both employment and advancement in the Information Technology industry are excellent. Over the past three years, the demand for IT professionals in Canada has doubled as baby boomers opt for retirement. The typical starting salary upon graduation is $45,000.
